:rocket: <h1>Running the Code</h1> :rocket:


To run the code, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the code is saved. Then, enter the following command:

```
python app.py [list of numbers] [target sum]
```

Replace <strong>[list of numbers]</strong> with a comma-separated list of integers and [target sum] with the target sum that you want to find pairs for.

For example, to find pairs of numbers in the list 1, 2, 3, 4 that add up to 5, you would enter the following command:

```
python app.py 1,2,3,4 5
```

The program will then print out any pairs of numbers from the list that add up to the target sum.

For example, the output for the above command would be:

```
[(1, 4), (2, 3)]
```
